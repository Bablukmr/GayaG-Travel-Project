        Gaya is a holy city beside the Falgu River, in the northeast Indian
        state of Bihar. Itâ€™s known for 18th-century Vishnupad Mandir, a
        riverside temple with an octagonal shrine. Close by, ancient Mangla
        Gauri Temple is set on a hilltop. To the north, Hindu devotees bath in a
        Brahma Kund pond before honoring their deceased ancestors atop Pretshila
        Hill. To the south lies the Hindu pilgrimage center of Bodh
